Type: Critical thinking

You should think about those questions:

## Find out how many flights

- How many flights depart?
  - How many boarding gates does that airport have?
    - How many flights each boarding gate check in everyday? You can consider one flight per hour. Is there any difference between day and night?
- How many flights arrives?
  - How many arriving gates does that airport have?
- Is there any difference between domestic flights and international flights?

## Find out how many passengers

- How many kinds of planes?
- How many seats does a plane have?
- How about crews?
- How many flights for each size?

## Anything else

- Is there any difference between day and night?
- How many people go there to drop a passenger off?
- How many people go there to pick a passenger up?
- Etc.
